The algorithm ignores obvious ""false positives"" contributing to the impossible travel conditions, such as VPNs and locations regularly used by other users in the organization.

Malware linked IP address,This risk detection type indicates sign-ins from IP addresses infected with malware that is known to actively communicate with a bot server.

Unfamiliar sign-in properties,"This risk detection type considers past sign-in history (IP, Latitude / Longitude and ASN) to look for anomalous sign-ins. The system stores information about previous locations used by a user, and considers these ""familiar"" locations. The risk detection is triggered when the sign-in occurs from a location that's not already in the list of familiar locations. Newly created users will be in ""learning mode"" for a period of time in which unfamiliar sign-in properties risk detections will be turned off while our algorithms learn the user's behavior. The learning mode duration is dynamic and depends on how much time it takes the algorithm to gather enough information about the user's sign-in patterns. The minimum duration is five days. A user can go back into learning mode after a long period of inactivity. The system also ignores sign-ins from familiar devices, and locations that are geographically close to a familiar location. We also run this detection for basic authentication (or legacy protocols). Because these protocols do not have modern properties such as client ID, there is limited telemetry to reduce false positives. We recommend our customers to move to modern authentication.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Proptection Center (IPC)
